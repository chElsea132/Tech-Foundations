# You can interact with items in the room (they end with a *)
# by running them as a command (a shell script).
#
# For example, to collect treasure:
#
# ./treasure
# 
# The . (dot) means *don't move*, and the name of the 
# script makes the code run.  This is known as a 
# relative path, and the . means the current room
# (directory).
# 
# You may have left treasure in the previous room.
# Go back to a previous directory with two dots,
# which means *take a step back*.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# cd ..
